To do:

* Update queries to only return media items
* Suppress posts
* Create a page template that can be used as the static homepage
* Remove post-specific cruft like posted-on and such.
* Expand list of mime types
* Consider nixing options in Customizer and Jetpack compat.
x Remove post navigation and all <head> links that point to adjacent items.
* Provide options to make either an open or closed system. Build only closed for now.
